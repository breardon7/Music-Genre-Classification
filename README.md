# Music-Genre-Classification

## Summary
This repository contains [Bradley Reardon](https://github.com/breardon7) and [Haruna Salim](https://github.com/BABAYEGAR)'s final project for George Washington University's DATS 6202:Machine Learning I course.
Our project objective was to apply an artifical neural network to a real world problem. For our project we applied preprocessing techniques and a multilayer perceptron to mp3 data to classify songs by genre.

## Data
[Data Source 1](https://www.kaggle.com/harish24/music-genre-classification)   

## Folders
* Code contains all of our code and data used in the project.
* Proposal contains the proposal for the project.
* Presentation contains a PowerPoint presentation of our project.
* Report contains a report of our findings from this project.

## Code Execution

1. To successfully execute the code, make sure you have following libraries installed on your python interpreter enviroment:

* sklearn 
* pyqt5 
* pydub 
* librosa 
* seaborn 
* pandas
* matplotlib

2. When you run the main.py file, it opens a window where you are required to select an .mp3 file of your choice.

3. On file select, the model prediction begins and the results are displayed on the Canvas. The Monophonic waveform of the selected .mp3 file is also displayed.
