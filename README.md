* pydub 
* librosa 
* seaborn 
* pandas
* matplotlib

2.When you run the main.py file, it opens a where you are required to select a .mp3 file of your choice.

3.On file select, the model prediction begins and after training, the prediction results are displayed on the Canvas. The Monophonic waveform is also displayed.
